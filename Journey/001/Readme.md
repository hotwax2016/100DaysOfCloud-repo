# Day 1 - Preparation Day

## Cloud Research

It's been a while since I last update my #100DaysOfCloud progress so I decided to reset my timeline and to start things over again. Following is the list of things I did on my preparation day.

- Went through [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Training 2020 - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hLmDS179YE) by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) just to refresh my memory on AWS.
- Configured AWS budget and new IAM user.

## Game Plan

I found this [great tutorial](https://serverless-stack.com/) on creating serverless applications in AWS. I plan to follow up with the tutorial and create my first serverless application in a week.
